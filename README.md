# Vocab in C

This program is a port of my favorite vocabulary-tainer.  It heps you memorizing 
vocabulary by repeating them until they sink in.   It is a console C program. 
Due to it's simplicity it will run in terminals on old UNIX computers, on Linux, 
Solaris, OS X, Amiga, etc.  By changing the #define DOS directive it will combile on 
Borland C and run on DOS and Windows.

Because it was ported from Commodore BASIC it need to be cleaned up.
When I have nothing better to do then I will rewrite it completely. 

I hope you enjoy using it.  I have included some voabulary for the JLPT exam.
